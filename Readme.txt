= How to use =
* As indicate the plugin functions with shortcodes. the root of the shortcode is [campay]
* The shortcode has three mandatory parameters which are
  * success_url : this parameter defines where to redirect the user after the payment was successful 
  * failure_url : this parameter defines where to redirect the user in case payment is not successful
  * button_text : this parameter defines the text to display on the button generated by the shortcode
* Apart from this parameters we have two other parameters which are not mandatory
  * amount : specify the amount the user has to pay. If this parameter is not set, user will be prompt to enter the amount he wish to pay for.
  * product_title : to set the object of the payment 
* Examples
  * [campay success_url="/thank-you/" amount=20 failure_url="/failure/" product_title="test" button_text="PAY"] 
  * [campay success_url="/thank-you/" failure_url="/failure/" product_title="test" button_text="DONATE"]
* After inserting the shortcode where you want to use it. the user will see on the page where is inserted a button with the title set
inviting him to make a payment. Once he clicks on the button he will be prompt with a window inviting him to put the mobile number
or the amount and mobile number to initiate the transaction.
